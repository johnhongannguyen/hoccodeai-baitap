Output:
In simple terms, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work as digital money that doesn't rely on banks or governments to operate. Instead, it uses a network of computers around the world to keep track of who owns what. When someone wants to send bitcoin to someone else, that transaction is shared across the network. These computers, or “nodes,” check and confirm the transaction is valid and that the sender actually has the bitcoin they're trying to spend. Once confirmed, the transaction is added to a public list called the blockchain, which is like a digital ledger that everyone can see but no one can secretly change.

Mining plays a key role in this system. Think of miners as people solving really complex puzzles with powerful computers. When they solve a puzzle, they get to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain and are rewarded with new bitcoin. This process not only creates new bitcoin (like printing money) but also makes it extremely difficult for anyone to cheat the system. Because it requires so much computing power, energy, and time, it’s nearly impossible for a hacker to tamper with past transactions without controlling most of the network’s power—which is very unlikely.

In the real world, cryptocurrencies are used for more than just investing or speculation. Businesses in some countries now accept bitcoin as payment, and in places like El Salvador, it’s even considered official money. It’s especially helpful in areas with unstable financial systems, giving people access to global trade and secure savings without needing a bank account. However, crypto also brings challenges like regulatory uncertainty and environmental concerns due to the high energy use of mining. Still, with ongoing innovations, cryptocurrencies continue to influence finance, tech, and global economics in powerful ways.

Terrible customer service. The hot honey chicken wraps we ordered were missing jalapeño chips. The ketchup packets we requested for were given 2, when we asked for 10 for a big order. The rest of the food was old and stale. We are never ordering from this location again.

A small location that works like any other but due to it's size can result in longer wait times and shortages of the product. I have lived near it long enough to know that much, food quality isn't bad and they generally get through the line quick if there is one.

Update: nice update to location, very app focused, less seating unfortunately but let's be honest everything's done online now.

## 🔍 Key Issues Identified

| Type                     | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coupling**             | `App::resolve(Database::class)` makes testing difficult. Use Dependency Injection.                             |
| **Limited session info** | Only stores `email` in session. Should include `id`, `name`, `role`, etc.                                      |
| **No null/array check**  | Assumes `$user['password']` exists. Can trigger warning if structure changes.                                  |
| **Security**             | Lacks email format validation / throttling / logging attempts (not critical here, but important in real apps). |
| **Session abstraction**  | Uses raw `$_SESSION`. Prefer a wrapper or helper for testability.                                              |

---

## ✅ Refactored, Readable, and Scalable Version

Here’s a cleaner and more extensible rewrite using good practices like dependency injection and clearer logic separation:

```php
class Authenticator
{
    protected Database $db;

    public function __construct(Database $db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    }

    /**
     * Attempt to authenticate a user by email and password.
     */
    public function attempt(string $email, string $password): bool
    {
        // Fetch the user by email
        $user = $this->findUserByEmail($email);

        // If user not found or password invalid, fail
        if (!$user || !isset($user['password']) || !password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
            return false;
        }

        // Successful login — store useful session data
        $this->login([
            'id'    => $user['id'] ?? null,
            'email' => $user['email'],
            'name'  => $user['name'] ?? '',
            'role'  => $user['role'] ?? 'user'
        ]);

        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Store the user in the session securely.
     */
    public function login(array $userData): void
    {
        $_SESSION['user'] = $userData;
        session_regenerate_id(true);
    }

    /**
     * Logout the user and destroy the session.
     */
    public function logout(): void
    {
        $_SESSION = [];
        if (session_status() === PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE) {
            session_destroy();
        }
    }

    /**
     * Find user by email.
     */
    protected function findUserByEmail(string $email): ?array
    {
        return $this->db
            ->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email", ['email' => $email])
            ->find() ?: null;
    }
}
```

## ✅ Benefits of the Refactored Version

| Improvement                 | Explanation                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependency Injection**    | Easier to test with mocks, cleaner architecture.                                       |
| **Structured session data** | More than just email — includes `id`, `name`, `role`.                                  |
| **Method extraction**       | `findUserByEmail()` improves readability and reuse.                                    |
| **Avoids assumptions**      | Uses null checks and `isset()` to avoid PHP warnings.                                  |
| **Better logout**           | Clears session array and checks `session_status()` before calling `session_destroy()`. |

Output:
Here’s a summary of the first **five chapters** of _Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone_ and a **character list** based on those chapters:

---

### **Summary of Chapters 1–5**

**Chapter 1 – The Boy Who Lived**  
We are introduced to the Dursleys, an ordinary family in Surrey. One night, magical events occur: owls fly by day, people in cloaks celebrate, and a baby named Harry Potter is left on the Dursleys' doorstep. Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid deliver the child after the defeat of Voldemort, who murdered Harry’s parents but mysteriously failed to kill Harry.

**Chapter 2 – The Vanishing Glass**  
Ten years later, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs and is mistreated by the Dursleys. On Dudley’s birthday, Harry accompanies the family to the zoo. There, he magically speaks to a snake and accidentally causes the glass to vanish, letting the snake escape. Harry is punished severely, though he doesn’t understand how he did it.

**Chapter 3 – The Letters from No One**  
Harry begins receiving mysterious letters addressed directly to him. The Dursleys try to prevent him from reading them by boarding up the house and fleeing to a remote hut. Despite their efforts, the letters keep arriving in bizarre and magical ways, increasing in number and persistence.

**Chapter 4 – The Keeper of the Keys**  
Hagrid bursts into the hut on Harry’s birthday to personally deliver his Hogwarts letter. He tells Harry the truth: Harry is a wizard, his parents were killed by Voldemort, and he is famous in the wizarding world. Hagrid scolds the Dursleys for hiding Harry's identity and begins to introduce him to the magical world.

**Chapter 5 – Diagon Alley**  
Hagrid takes Harry shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley. They visit Gringotts Bank and collect a mysterious package for Dumbledore. Harry is astonished by the magical world and purchases his first wand. He meets Draco Malfoy and feels uncertain about his views. Hagrid gives Harry his pet owl, Hedwig, and tells him more about Hogwarts and Voldemort.
